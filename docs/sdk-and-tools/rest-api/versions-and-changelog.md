## **Overview**

This page offers a high level overview of the important releases of the Elrond Proxy API, along with recommendations (such as upgrade or transitioning recommendations) for API consumers.

Documentation in this section is preliminary and subject to change.
:::

## **Elrond Proxy HTTP API [v1.1.0](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-proxy-go/releases/tag/v1.1.0)**

This is the API launched at the Genesis.

## **Elrond Proxy HTTP API [v1.1.1](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-proxy-go/releases/tag/v1.1.1)**

This API version brought new features such as the [_hyperblock_-related endpoints](/sdk-and-tools/rest-api/blocks#get-hyperblock-by-nonce), useful for monitoring the blockchain. Furthermore, the `GET transaction` endpoint has been adjusted to include extra fields - for example, the so-called _hyperblock coordinates_ (the _nonce_ and the _hash_ of the containing hyperblock).

This API **has never been deployed to the central instance** of the Elrond Proxy, available at [gateway.elrond.com](https://gateway.elrond.com/). However, until November 2020, **this API has been deployed on-premises** to several partners and 3rd party services (such as Exchange systems) - in the shape of [Observing Squads](/integrators/observing-squad), set up via the Mainnet installation scripts - version [e1.0.0](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go-scripts-mainnet/releases/tag/e1.0.0).

This version of the API requires Observer Nodes with tag [e1.1.0](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/releases/tag/e1.1.0) or greater.

There are **no breaking changes** between API **v1.1.0** and API **v1.1.1** - neither in terms of structure and format of the requests / responses, nor in the scheme of the URL. **However**, in terms of semantics, the following fixes might lead to breaking changes for some API consumers:

- `GET transaction` endpoint has been fixed to report the appropriate status **invalid** for actually _invalid transactions_ (e.g. not enough balance). In v1.1.0, the reported status was imprecise: **partially-executed**.

:::warning
As of November 2020, new API consumers are recommended to use a newer version of the API.

**v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 will be deprecated** once all existing API consumers are known to have been upgraded to a more recent version.
:::

## **Elrond Proxy HTTP API [v1.1.3](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-proxy-go/releases/tag/v1.1.3)**

This API version brought additions - new endpoints, such as `network/economics` or `address/shard`. Furthermore, the response of `vm-values` endpoints has been altered. Though, perhaps the most significant change is **the renaming of transaction statuses**.

This version of the API requires Observer Nodes with tag [v1.1.6](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/releases/tag/v1.1.6) or greater.

Between API **v1.1.1** and API **v1.1.3**, the API consumer would observe the following **breaking changes**:

- All fields of `vm-values` endpoints has been renamed (changed casing, among others).
- The possible set of values for the transaction statuses has been changed: **executed** has been renamed to **success.** The statuses **received** and **partially-executed** have been merged under the status **pending**, while the status **not-executed** has been renamed to **fail**. For API consumers to not be affected by this change, they should follow the recommendations in [Querying the Blockchain](/integrators/querying-the-blockchain).

:::important
As of November 2020, new API consumers are recommended to switch to this version (or a more recent one) of the API. An Elrond Proxy instance providing this API is already available in the **staging environment** [api-backup.elrond.com](https://api-backup.elrond.com/).

For API consumers that use **on-premises Observing Squads**, an updated installer will be provided (on this matter, the work is in progress).
